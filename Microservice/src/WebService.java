/*A web service is a way to share data between two disparate systems or a wey to retrieve data to display in your
application .
Webservices are design to communicate with other programs or applications rather than directly with users, and are
often used to integrate system allowing  to data flow seamlessly between th two.

The communication typically happens between a client and a server.

Client - The client makes a request for data.
Server - The server responds to the client's request.


How Web Services Work

Step 1: The web service provider (the person who created the web service) defines a standard format for requests
and also for the responses provided.

Step 2: The client sends a request to the web service across the network.

Step 3: The web service receives the request and performs an action (like query a database or perform a
calculation) and sends a response back to the calling client.

Select TWO benefits of web services.

1.Reusability
2.Usability


              Web Service	                         API

1.All web services are APIs.                       	All APIs are not web services.

2.It supports XML.	                      Responses are formatted using Web API's MediaTypeFormatter into XML, JSON,
                                          or any other given format.

3.You need a SOAP protocol to send or receive and data over the network.
 Therefore it does not have light-weight architecture.	                       API has a light-weight architecture.

4.It can be used by any client who understands XML.	          It can be used by a client who understands JSON or XML.

5.Web service uses three styles: REST, SOAP, and XML-RPC
for communication.	                                            API can be used for any style of communication.

It provides supports only for the HTTP protocol.	It provides support for the HTTP/s protocol: URL Request/Response
                                                    Headers, etc.
